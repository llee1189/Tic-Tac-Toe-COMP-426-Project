COMP 426 Final Project
A tic-tac-toe game that incorporates Firebase's login system.  

A final class project that involved using an assortment of concepts learned throughout the semester. The login system in the beginning is done through Firebase's authentication. The board itself is created through manipulating grid display and columns, and the state of the board is kept track with an array in JavaScript. User input done through Event "onclicks", and the board is recreated for each move. Using React would have removed the need for recreating the board for every move.
The website also includes a rough dark-mode option and other miscellaneous tools that satisfied a rubric.
